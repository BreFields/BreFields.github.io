    <h3>In The Now</h3>
    
    "Suddenly, in the middle of a page, he heard it.
     <br>
        No sounds of footsteps, no people chattering, no radios, no bamboo, no kotos being tuned.
     <br>
        In that short moment, Yoshio couldn’t even hear the sound of his own breath. 
        <br>
        Everything felt still inside him. Peaceful, like the garden after it snowed. 
        <br>
        Like feather-stuffed futons drying in the sun.
        <br>
        Silence had been there all along."

    <h3>LA Devotee</h3>
    
   "I noticed in New York, where the traffic is so bad and the air is so bad … you get into a taxi and very frequently the poor taxi driver is just beside himself with irritation. And one day I got into one and the driver began talking a blue streak, accusing absolutely everyone of being wrong. You know he was full of irritation about everything, and I simply remained quiet. I did not answer his questions, I did not enter into a conversation, and very shortly the driver began changing his ideas and simply through my being silent he began, before I got out of the car, saying rather nice things about the world around him."</p>

    <h3>In The Beginning</h3>
    
    <p>"I got fascinated by silence; by what happens to the human spirit, to identity and personality when the talking stops, when you press the off button, when you venture out into that enormous emptiness. I was interested in silence as a lost cultural phenomenon, as a thing of beauty and as a space that had been explored and used over and over again by different individuals, for different reasons and with wildly differing results. I began to use my own life as a sort of laboratory to test some ideas and to find out what it felt like. Almost to my surprise, I found I loved silence. It suited me. I got greedy for more. In my hunt for more silence, I found this valley and built a house here, on the ruins of an old shepherd’s cottage."
