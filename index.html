<p class="three"> 
Hi, my name's Breanna. I'm a junior at The New School
studying Journalism + Design. I was born in the suburbs of Bakersfield, CA
and moved to Los Angeles as soon as I graduated from high school. 
While living in LA, my focus was on playing guitar in bands. I've been a musician
for 8 years. Now, I live in West Village and spend my time producing electronic, going to school and traveling.
